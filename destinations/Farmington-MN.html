            <h2>Farmington, Minnesota</h2>

            <p>Tucked just southeast of the Twin Cities, Farmington offers the laid-back rhythms of small-town Minnesota—wooded lots, quiet streets, and the kind of evenings where only frogs and wind in the pines stir the hush. But now this region is poised on the edge of transformation: a sprawling data-center campus, backed by Tract Management and signed off under a non-disclosure agreement with the city, is proposed just one street from long-standing homes.</p>
            <p>Imagine staying in a boutique lodge by evening, sipping something warm and local, then waking to a walk through oak and maple, considering the juxtaposition: pastures and privacy joined at the hip with what might become one of Minnesota’s largest computing hubs. Residents like Nancy Aarestad report that the city staff and developer “were working for months” before neighborhood flyers appeared — and that powerful non-disclosure agreements shadowed the entire process.</p>
            <p>For the discerning traveler looking for that off-beat vantage, Farmington offers both calm and complexity: forest-fringed lots just minutes from major metro corridors, local cafés and trails stocked with sun filters and slow-moving bikes, and underneath it all… a story of infrastructure, land use, and the future of data. Whether you’re drawn by woodland walks or intrigued by tech-ground shifting beneath quiet streets, carve out a day here. Take a long pause at the edge of a field, breeze through the storefronts, watch the sunlight shift on signage…and lean in to the question this town now carries: how do we build big without leaving quiet behind?</p>
