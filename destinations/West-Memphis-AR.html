            <h2>West Memphis, Arkansas</h2>

            <p>Just across the Mississippi from Memphis, West Memphis offers something unexpected for a discerning traveller: gentle river‑view landscapes, tree‑lined suburban roads, and now a quietly momentous transformation in progress. A massive data‑centre campus — developed under the name Groot LLC — has been officially confirmed to be backed by Google. </p>
            <p>Imagine a long‑weekend stay where you lodge in a boutique riverside hotel, wander along the levee, enjoy dining in the city’s revitalising downtown, and then step back and notice: a sprawling 1,178‑acre campus is planned just beyond the outskirts, with five data‑centre buildings, internal roads, a massive substation and industrial­‑scale infrastructure creeping into what was once quiet fields.</p>
            <p>Here’s the twist: the benefit for a luxury‑traveller is the intersection of ambiance and awareness. The investment being made isn’t just about servers — it includes a $10 billion scale (with potential for even more) and a deep partnership with the local utility Entergy Arkansas to build new battery storage and solar resources.</p>
            <p>Stroll the waterfront at dusk. Sip a glass of wine on a terrace. And know this: the next morning you might glimpse construction markers or environmental‑review filings on road signage, a subtle reminder that the future is building itself here. West Memphis offers refinement in the shadows of innovation and invites a quiet reflection—luxury softened by purpose.</p>
