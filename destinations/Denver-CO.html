            <h2>Denver, Colorado</h2>

            <p>Nestled on the edge of Denver’s industrial belt, the Elyria-Swansea neighbourhood offers a surprising mix of grit and possibility — and now a new chapter: a large data-centre campus is rising at 4900 Race Street, slated to draw up to 60 megawatts of power and millions of gallons of water each day.</p>
            <p>For the luxury-traveller who cares not only about fine lodging and local charm, but also the hidden layers of place, this region invites reflection: picture yourself staying in a boutique hotel near the city, then stepping out at dawn into a neighbourhood already familiar with heavy infrastructure — the highway hum, the refinery backdrop, the river mist. And yet, here’s the twist: the new development will require nearly a million gallons of water per day in a dry climate where drought, restrictions and high-altitude skies already govern everything.</p>
            <p>Electricity demand, too, looms large. The facility’s electrical load could match a small town — utilities warn that such growth may ripple into higher residential bills and strain on the grid.</p>
            <p>What this means for your stay: after a daytime winery visit just outside the city, unwind with a river-view cocktail as dusk settles. Then, linger a little longer and watch the amber light glint off coolers and conduits behind the scenes. Sense the quiet hum, the hidden gears of digital life turning just miles away. Enjoy finely crafted cuisine and soft spa lighting, but carry in the back of your mind the dual story of luxury and infrastructure, of urban escape and global connectivity.</p>
            <p>Here, Denver doesn’t just offer fine design and high comfort—it challenges you to see how progress and place can coexist, how luxury and load-bearing might share the same soil. Let the experience be both restorative and aware.</p>

            <h3>🏨 Stay – The Ramble Hotel, RiNo Arts District</h3>
            <p>Tucked into the River North Art District — a short drive from the proposed data-center site — The Ramble combines old-world Parisian style with industrial Denver edge. Exposed brick, velvet seating, curated lighting and the iconic Death & Co cocktail bar make it a favorite for design-conscious travellers.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ask for a corner suite overlooking Larimer Street for sweeping skyline views framed by urban art walls.</p>
            
            <h3>🍽️ Dine – Tavernetta</h3>
            <p>Located near Union Station, Tavernetta delivers refined northern-Italian cuisine paired with award-winning wine service and warm mountain-modern interiors. Its atmosphere of candlelight and craftsmanship contrasts beautifully with the nearby hum of industrial Denver.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try the agnolotti del plin and a glass of Barolo — perfect after a day exploring RiNo’s art alleys or the Platte River walk.</p>

            <h3>💆 Relax – The Oxford Club, Spa & Salon</h3>
            <p>In Denver’s historic LoDo district, The Oxford Club blends timeless luxury with sustainability — offering organic treatments and aromatherapy sessions designed to counteract urban stress. The setting echoes Denver’s balance between renewal and industrial growth.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Book the Alpine Stone Massage followed by a steam-room session — a restorative pause before a night out downtown.</p>
